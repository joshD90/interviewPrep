First complete it without an api

we will need a seat object, flight object, passenger object, airport object
Flights can be of a various different type such as 747 or 737 which will change the layout of seats.
we will abstract a booking object to operate between these objects.
useCustom hook to do all get requests
useReducer to populate flights

seat will have a row and seat number - maybe do this from 1 - number of seats.
Seats will also have booked or not booked and a possible passenger name attached to it.

Flights will have an airport departures - this will be populated by a method - can i do a custom hook within a class perhaps? I will have to see, perhaps i will have to do it as a dependency injection.
Flights will have departure airport, landing airport, departure time, landing time, flight duration.
Extending onto the flight you can vary the number of seats that are available.

Airport will be a collection of departing flights and landing flights and GET methods to populate these.  Need some dependency injection again for this.
